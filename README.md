Automatic email script, originally made for McGill PTOT Orientation Week 2021 by Nicholas Yiphoiyen  

Three .txt files are needed, see examples of .txt files in the repo  
1- NAME_EMAIL.txt --> has the names and emails of the sponsors separated by a comma, one sponsor per line (I.E firstname lastname ,email)  
2- ALREADY_SENT_EMAILS.txt --> emails, name of the sponsors that were properly sent an email  
3- TEMPLATE_TEXT --> text that you want to send to the sponsors, set the name of the person as ${PERSON_NAME}  

You need to set the subject of the email and add any attachments you want to send with the email as an array (don't forget to put the file extension ex: .pdf, .png)  

Don't forget to put your email address, password also  
Two-step verification must be disabled on your email account & allow less-secure apps to access your account (just google it)  

CAREFUL : Test it out with your personal email before sending the emails to sponsors
